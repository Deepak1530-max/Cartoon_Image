# Cartoon_Image
Overview
This is a Data Science and Computer Vision project that transforms real images into cartoon-style visuals using Python and OpenCV. The process involves applying a series of image filters and transformations like smoothing, edge detection, and thresholding to achieve a sketch-pen cartoon effect.

🛠️ Tools Used
Python – Programming language used for image processing
OpenCV – Core library for computer vision and filtering techniques
NumPy – For efficient array operations and image data manipulation
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab – For interactive coding and visualization
🎯 Objectives
Apply image processing techniques to give a cartoon-like appearance to real-world images
Use bilateral filtering for smoothening while preserving edges
Convert images to grayscale and apply median blur to reduce noise
Use adaptive thresholding to detect edges and create a sketch effect
Combine all processed layers to compile the final cartoonized image
Encourage experimentation with filters and thresholding techniques to explore various cartoon styles
🖼️ Output
The final output is a cartoonized version of the input image with smoothed color regions and highlighted edges, resembling a comic or hand-drawn sketch.

📌 Note
Computer Vision is all about experimentation. You are encouraged to tweak filter parameters and threshold techniques to observe different cartooning effects.
